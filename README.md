# Currency CRUD Application

A simple Currency CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application to manage currency exchange rates.

## Current Status

- **Frontend:** Completed and fully functional  
- **Backend:** Partially implemented, some endpoints missing or incomplete  
- **Database:** Not fully integrated yet 

## Features

- Add, view, update, and delete currency exchange rates (frontend ready)  
- Backend APIs partially available  

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React   
- Backend: Java Spring Boot (partial)  

## How to Run

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder (if applicable):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies and start the app:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. Frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port)

### Backend (Partial)

1. In the backend folder, run:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Backend API runs at `http://localhost:8080`

> **Note:** Some backend endpoints are still under development.

## Planned Improvements

- Complete backend CRUD endpoints  
- Connect backend fully with database  
- Add validation and error handling
